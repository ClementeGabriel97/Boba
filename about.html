 <p1 class="p1">The Jedi Order tracked down Jango Fett along with the CIS on Geonosis. Boba Fett's father was killed by Jedi master Mace Windu. He takes his father's helmet implying that is how he obtained his madalorian armor in the original trilogy. (image to the right)
 </p1>
   <p2 class="p2">Boba has appeared in the original trilogy and prequels; however, he only has shown up in the only one of the prequel movies. He is only a child in Episode 2 "Attack of The Clones'”. Boba Fett has a more important role in the 2 movies for the original trilogy. Boba Fett is an unaltered clone of Jango Fett. He is the template in which the Kaminoans (an alien race that is dedicated to cloning) used to create a clone army for the Republic. Boba Fett is seen as a boy in Episode 2 "Attack of the Clones'” when Obi Wan is sent to investigate the assassin attempt on Senator Amidala. (video at the bottom for Boba's first appearance)

    Fast Forward to the OT in Episode 5 "The Empire Strikes Back", Boba Fett has grown up and is known as the "most feared bounty hunter" and works for space gangster Jabba the Hutt.
    Boba's mission in the OT is to bring back Han Solo, pilot of the Millenium Falcon, because Han did not pay back Jabba. At the same time, the Empire is on the hunt for rebels
    after they destroyed the first death star. Han Solo being one of those rebels, Boba joined the Empire's hunt party. They eventually captured them on Cloud City. Han Solo is placed frozen in carbonite
    and given to Boba Fett to bring back to Jabba the Hutt's palace on Tatooine. We do not see Han or Boba until Episode 6 "Return of the Jedi”. Han Solo's capture is the segway into the next movie.
    The heroes of the OT were caught trying to free Han from his carbonite prison at Jabba's palace. They were taken to be eaten by the Sarlacc Pit. Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker manages to free himself with the help of R2-D2 and free the others.
    Boba tries to stop the heroes but instead ends up in the stomach of the Sarlacc Pit. (Video of Boba Fett being eaten by Sarlacc Pit at the bottom)
